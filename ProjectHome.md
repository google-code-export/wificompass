WiFi Compass helps to find the location of indoor Access Points by analyzing the WiFi Received Signal Strengh Indication of different measurig points in the building. A built-in Step Detection Algorithm that uses the accelerometer tracks the user movement in a building. Measuring point positions can also be set manually.

WiFi Compass was developed by Paul Woelfel and Thomas Konrad as a part of their [master thesis at University of Applied Sciences St. Poelten, Austria, which could be downloaded here](http://code.google.com/p/wificompass/downloads/detail?name=Diplomarbeit.pdf). It is published as Open Source software Google Code.

It can be downloaded directly from [Google Play or the Android Market](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.fhstp.wificompass) on your device. You could also use this QR Code:
